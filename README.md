> **"I see a parking spot, but will my car actually fit?"** - ParkVision answers this question in real-time.

## 🎯 The Problem

Existing parking apps like SpotHero and ParkWhiz only show **availability**, not **compatibility**. 30% of urban traffic is vehicles searching for parking, often wasting time trying to fit into incompatible spaces.

**ParkVision solves this by combining:**
- 📱 **Real-time computer vision** for space measurement
- 🧮 **Physics-based algorithms** for fit calculation  
- 🚙 **Vehicle-specific analysis** for accurate predictions

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Real-Time Analysis
- **Live camera processing** using iPhone camera
- **Instant compatibility results** with confidence scoring
- **Multiple vehicle support** (sedans, SUVs, trucks)

### 🎯 Accurate Measurements
- **OpenCV-powered** space detection and measurement
- **Reference object scaling** (license plates, parking lines)
- **Perspective correction** for accurate dimensions

### 📊 Smart Predictions
- **Physics-based calculations** (clearance, turning radius)
- **Safety margin integration** (configurable buffer zones)
- **Confidence scoring** based on measurement quality

### 🚗 Vehicle Database
- **20+ popular vehicle models** with exact dimensions
- **Custom vehicle support** for user-specific cars
- **Turning radius analysis** for maneuverability

## 🧪 Algorithm Details

### Core Detection Pipeline

```python
class ParkingSpaceDetector:
    def detect_space(self, camera_frame):
        # 1. Preprocess image
        processed = self.preprocess_image(camera_frame)
        
        # 2. Detect parking lines and boundaries
        boundaries = self.detect_boundaries(processed)
        
        # 3. Calculate real-world dimensions
        dimensions = self.calculate_dimensions(boundaries)
        
        # 4. Assess measurement confidence
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(boundaries)
        
        return SpaceDimensions(
            length=dimensions.length,
            width=dimensions.width,
            confidence=confidence

```

### Vehicle Compatibility Algorithm

```python
class VehicleFitCalculator:
    def can_vehicle_fit(self, space_dims, vehicle, safety_margin=0.3):
        # Physics-based compatibility check
        length_check = vehicle.length <= (space_dims.length - safety_margin)
        width_check = vehicle.width <= (space_dims.width - safety_margin)
        
        # Advanced maneuverability analysis
        turning_check = self.check_turning_radius(space_dims, vehicle)
        
        return FitResult(
            fits=all([length_check, width_check, turning_check]),
            confidence=space_dims.confidence,
