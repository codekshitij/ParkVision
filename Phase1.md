## Project Overview

The Smart Parking Fit Analyzer is a real-time computer vision system that determines whether a specific vehicle will fit in an available parking space. Unlike existing parking apps that only show availability, this system analyzes actual space dimensions and provides personalized compatibility predictions.

### Key Innovation
**"I see a parking spot, but will my car actually fit?"** - This system answers that question in real-time using smartphone cameras and computer vision algorithms.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- **Existing parking apps** (SpotHero, ParkWhiz) only show availability, not compatibility
- **Smart parking sensors** detect occupied/empty status but not dimensional information
- **Static tools** exist (automobiledimension.com) but require manual input and aren't integrated with real-time parking data

### Gap in Market
- 30% of urban traffic is searching for parking spaces
- No solution addresses vehicle-space compatibility in real-time
- Drivers waste time attempting to park in incompatible spaces

### Our Solution
Real-time parking space measurement using computer vision + algorithmic vehicle compatibility analysis + mobile integration.

## Technical Innovation

### Core Algorithm Approach
This is primarily **algorithmic/rule-based** with **OpenCV for measurement**, not traditional supervised learning.

```python
def can_vehicle_fit(vehicle_dims, space_dims, clearance_buffer=0.3):
    """
    Core physics-based algorithm
    vehicle_dims: {length, width, height, turning_radius}
    space_dims: {length, width, height, obstacles}
    clearance_buffer: safety margin in meters
    """
    length_fits = vehicle_dims.length <= (space_dims.length - clearance_buffer)
    width_fits = vehicle_dims.width <= (space_dims.width - clearance_buffer) 
    height_fits = vehicle_dims.height <= space_dims.height
    turning_radius_ok = check_maneuverability(vehicle_dims, space_dims)
    
    return all([length_fits, width_fits, height_fits, turning_radius_ok])
```

### OpenCV's Role
**Real-time Space Measurement using computer vision:**

```python
def measure_parking_space(camera_feed):
    # Edge detection to find space boundaries
    edges = cv2.Canny(camera_feed, 50, 150)
    
    # Find contours of parking space
    contours = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Calculate real-world dimensions using perspective transformation
    space_corners = detect_space_corners(contours)
    real_dimensions = perspective_to_real_world(space_corners)
    
    return real_dimensions
```

### Machine Learning Component (Secondary)
- **User feedback collection**: "Did your car actually fit?"
- **Pattern learning**: Driver skill levels, vehicle-specific quirks
- **Confidence adjustment**: Refine predictions based on historical accuracy

## System Architecture
